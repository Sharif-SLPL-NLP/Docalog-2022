We cannot accept photocopies or notarized copies. All documents must be current not expired. We cannot accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. \\n\\nWhat original documents do I need? \\nCitizenship We can accept only certain documents as proof of U.S. citizenship. These include : U.S. passport ; Certificate of Naturalization N-550/N-570 ; Certificate of Citizenship N-560/N-561 ; Certificate of Report of Birth DS-1350 ; Consular Report of Birth Abroad FS-240, CRBA. Age You must present your foreign birth certificate if you have it or can get it within 10 days. If not , we will consider other documents such as your passport or a document issued by the Department of Homeland Security DHS as evidence of your age. Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview. We will ask for evidence to show you do not have a Social Security number. Here are examples of documents you can use to prove a Social Security number was never assigned : If you lived outside the United States for an extended period , a current or previous passport , school and/or employment records , and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show you do not have a Social Security number. If you have lived in the United States and you are applying for an original Social Security number , we may ask you for information about the schools you attended or we may ask you to provide copies of tax records that would show you were never assigned a Social Security number. Identity We can accept only certain documents as proof of identity. An acceptable document must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph. For example , as proof of identity Social Security must see your : U.S. driver's license ; State - issued non - driver identification card ; or U.S. passport. If you do not have one of these specific documents or you cannot get a replacement for one of them within 10 days , we will ask to see other documents. Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph : Employee identification card ; School identification card ; Health insurance card not a Medicare card ; or U.S. military identification card. Note We may use one document for two purposes. For example , we may use your U.S. passport as proof of both citizenship and identity. However , you must provide at least two separate documents.\""

              "\"Original Card for a Foreign Born U.S. Citizen Adult \\nImportant You must present original documents or copies certified by the agency that issued them. We cannot accept photocopies or notarized copies. All documents must be current not expired. We cannot accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. \\n\\nWhat original documents do I need? \\nCitizenship We can accept only certain documents as proof of U.S. citizenship. These include : U.S. passport ; Certificate of Naturalization N-550/N-570 ; Certificate of Citizenship N-560/N-561 ; Certificate of Report of Birth DS-1350 ; Consular Report of Birth Abroad FS-240, CRBA. Age You must present your foreign birth certificate if you have it or can get it within 10 days. If not , we will consider other documents such as your passport or a document issued by the Department of Homeland Security DHS as evidence of your age. Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview. We will ask for evidence to show you do not have a Social Security number. Here are examples of documents you can use to prove a Social Security number was never assigned : If you lived outside the United States for an extended period , a current or previous passport , school and/or employment records , and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show you do not have a Social Security number. If you have lived in the United States and you are applying for an original Social Security number , we may ask you for information about the schools you attended or we may ask you to provide copies of tax records that would show you were never assigned a Social Security number. Identity We can accept only certain documents as proof of identity. An acceptable document must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph. For example , as proof of identity Social Security must see your : U.S. driver's license ; State - issued non - driver identification card ; or U.S. passport. If you do not have one of these specific documents or you cannot get a replacement for one of them within 10 days , we will ask to see other documents. Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph : Employee identification card ; School identification card ; Health insurance card not a Medicare card ; or U.S. military identification card. Note We may use one document for two purposes. For example , we may use your U.S. passport as proof of both citizenship and identity. However , you must provide at least two separate documents.\""
